### MATLAB

MATLAB (Matrix LABoratory) is a widely used numerical computing environment, a fourth generation programming language, whose applications transcend the borders of engineering. It makes programming easier, especially to solve numerical problems. From being a tool for basic graph plotting and data crunching to complex tasks like Digital Signal Processing and Embedded Simulations, MATLAB is one of the most powerful software around. In 2012, the IEEE gave Cleve Moler, creator of MATLAB, its annual Computer Pioneer Award “For improving the quality of mathematical software, making it more accessible and creating MATLAB.” With this workshop in the IEEE DTU TechWeek, we will start from scratch to advanced functionality of MATLAB.

### Software Development

These days, we can’t do without our phones being ‘smart’. Big enterprises are looking for intelligent machines to improve manufacturing as well as to maximise profits.  A successful application can ensure a million dollar start-up, bring the world together, compliment research and scientific breakthroughs , help manage tones of data efficiently and what not. New software applications constantly aim at reducing human efforts, and digitalize even the smallest of daily tasks.  So come join us, to learn and get a peek into the world of software development encompassing mobile application development, PC software development and open source software development.

### Website Development

We interact with websites everyday whether it’s for social networking, entertainment, research purposes or online trading of goods and services.  Websites have evolved as an integral part of our lives and act as an interface to the charms of the internet. Web-developers are constantly seeking to make the web more interactive, attractive, fast and user-friendly. Web-development skills are in great demand and worth learning. This workshop would provide an insight on how to create interactive websites and introduce you to the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL and how to use them together effectively to create amazing websites.

### Solid Works

Do you have EG-itis (an ailment caused by making an endless number of Engineering Graphics sheets late into the night)? Common Symptoms: Mind-numbing headaches, fatigue, apart from developing an irrational hatred for what should be a fairly interesting subject. Are those 2-d- to 3-D conversions killing your head and ruining you college experience? Well, look no further, for help has arrived! Solid Works is the workshop for you if you want the computer to sketch in 2-D for you and model and simulate the same sketch in 3-D. No need to leave anything to imagination if you are well acquainted with this software. Whether it is product designing or manufacturing tools design, SolidWorks makes your job easy. And we make it even easier by teaching you the A-Z of this 3-D CAD Design software.

### Programming

Code is Logic. Code is Poetry. And programming is an ability that’s fast becoming a necessity rather than a novelty, irrespective of branch and even outside the engineering domain. The workshop aims to give an insight into thinking in terms of algorithms, the mark of a good programmer, while giving the basics of C/C++ in a fun, yet challenging manner. Only prerequisite- A logical and a receptive mind.

### Wattack

Amongst all the teaching and exposure to new concepts, WATTACK, the annual quizzing event by IEEE Power and Energy Society, offers a change for some livewire competition (pun intended). The event not only promises to be a test of aptitude in the field of Electrical Circuits, but a refreshing and energetic start to the journey of the student enthusiast and IEEE PES in knowledge enrichment and sharing.

### Graphic Designing

We have all blurred a Facebook DP every now and then. Photoshop means the blur tool and a few more tools to the lay man. But there’s more to Photoshop when it comes to designing. Posters, banners, fliers and all give an event a physical image whilst without a pictorial representation; the event is just an idea, a picture in a mind until a proper design makes it more real. Even a website cannot be developed straightaway without designing a user interface. The designing workshop explores every nook and cranny of Photoshop and by the end of this workshop, you’ll be able to design masterpieces starting from simple grayscales.

### Animation

It is one thing to read about something in a book, and it’s entirely different when you watch a tutorial on the same topic. That’s the difference between animate and inanimate objects. In simple language, animation just makes life a lot more interesting. With this workshop in IEEE TechWeek, we will teach you how to make models in animation starting from scratch and then how that same model is to be animated; the sound effects to be added and how they are added. Not only do you learn how to make clippings in 3-D animation, you also get to learn how to make simple videos using post production. Remember that last movie trailer that you thought was amazing? Well after this workshop you will get to try your hand at making something similar.

### Robotics
Fresh out of school and just stepping into the unchartered territory of technology and robotics? You need to have an idea of what robotics is first of all. Electronics, robotics and all these other big words? IEEE DTU will try and make these seem simple for you in the TechWeek this year. From simple mechanical bots to line following robots, this workshop will open a whole new area of interest. Starting from scratch to introducing you to the brilliance of Arduino, join us as we reinvent robotics.
